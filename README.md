# OldFileCleanup
Everyone knows the problem of old unused files anywhere on their harddrives.<br>
This app will search and list all old files, so you can decide, if you want to delete or keep them.
## Vision
you start the application, it presents you all files older then x months grouped in foldernames with their last modified date.<br>
you can select the available harddrives and set the daterange to filter the content.<br>
when you decide, you don't need a file or folder anymore, you can delete it with a single mouse click, no need to open the file explorer and search for the file/folder individually.

## Roadmap
- create logic to find all old files
- create UI to present the results
- add date input to set how old the files should be
- group files together to be presented within folders
- add delete file/folder logic
